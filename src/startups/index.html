<p>Dated: April 24, 2015</p>

<p>Subject: Open Letter to TRAI from India’s Internet Startup Ecosystem</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>We are writing to you as founders, investors and stakeholders of Indian startup companies that make content and applications for the global Internet.</p>

<p>This transformational nature of the Internet is not because of a fundamental technological breakthrough, but because its core principles concerning interoperability and non-discrimination created a single global market for innovation. Unlike every other global telecommunication network before it, users have equal access, at equal cost, to every service on the global Internet — irrespective of the location or identity of the service provider.</p>

<p>This is the principle of net neutrality. Let us be clear on what we mean by that phrase: telecom companies, when operating as Internet service providers, are in the business of carrying traffic between the global Internet and its customers. Everything about this service — whether it’s speed, cost, reliability, availability or something else — must be equal for all traffic going to a particular user, irrespective of the provider of the content, its application or the consumer device used.</p>

<p>Net neutrality allows our startups to create disruptive new services and offer it to the entire global audience of Internet users. It gives us a chance to compete with large companies while we’re still a small, underfunded team. All of the popular services on the Internet — Facebook, Google, Twitter, WhatsApp — were created by startups like us that went on to compete with and displace the dominant players of the day.</p>

<p>This principle, which has held strong for the over twenty years, is now under threat. Telecom service providers seek to increase their profit by leveraging their position as users’ gatekeepers in ways that would undermine net neutrality and fragment the Internet. In response to this threat to the open, innovative Internet, telecom regulators in several countries including Chile, the Netherlands, Brazil and the US have chosen to uphold the consumer interest by creating regulations to enforce net neutrality.</p>

<p>In this context, we find several aspects of the recent consultation paper by TRAI very troubling:</p>

<p>1. While the need of the hour is to enforce net neutrality and protect the level playing field for innovators on the Internet, the consultation paper is dedicated to an unnecessary and indefensible proposal to create a regulatory regime for application and content providers — a move that will endanger innovation on the Internet and extinguish our thriving startup ecosystem.</p>

<p>2. On net neutrality, the consultation paper parrots the telecom industry’s arguments while ignoring the legitimate concerns of consumers and Internet startups.</p>

<p>3. The entire consultation paper raises serious suspicions of a pro-industry and anti-consumer bias by its author. It includes a purported magazine quote that seems heavily altered to favour the telecom industry’s position. It includes a poison pill designed to help the telecom industry challenge TRAI’s authority to enforce net neutrality in litigation.</p>

<p>4. The telecom industry’s financial interests are discussed at great length, but there is no discussion of the consumer interest or of the promotion of a competitive internet market anywhere in the paper.</p>

<p>In light of these serious problems, we have taken the liberty of disregarding the twenty loaded and repetitive questions, replacing them with the four balanced questions that should have been asked instead:</p>

<p class="question">1. Should TRAI enact regulation to require that telecom service providers (TSPs) respect net neutrality? How should net neutrality be defined? What practices should be prohibited?</p>

<p>Yes. The specifics may be modelled on the regulation in Chile, the Netherlands, Brazil or the US. Blocking, throttling and paid prioritization (including zero rating) should be prohibited. Narrowly defined reasonable network management practices may be allowed, subject to transparency, diligent oversight and material penalties for violations.</p>

<p>In the interest of preventing fragmentation of the Internet, licensed TSPs should be forbidden to offer any data services other than access to the global Internet. </p>

<p class="question">2. Are content and application providers (CAPs, incorrectly termed OTTs in the consultation paper) liable to compensate TSPs for carrying “their” traffic?</p>

<p>No. This question comes from an underlying misconception that TSPs provide a service to CAPs. In reality, TSPs sell to consumers the service of connecting them to the global Internet, which by definition includes access to every lawful CAP. The innovative services provided by CAPs are the primary reason there is any consumer demand for the highly profitable Internet service offered by TSPs.</p>

<p>To reiterate, when traffic is within the TSP’s network, it is not the CAP’s traffic, but the traffic ordered by, and paid for, by the TSP’s customer. There is no liability on the CAP to pay for its transmission. On the other hand, the TSPs do have the obligation to carry traffic from every CAP to each customer, as this is the service that it has advertised and sold to consumers.</p>

<p class="question">3. Should CAPs be regulated by TRAI? How can the concerns of user privacy, law enforcement access etc. be satisfied?</p>

<p>No. CAPs do not require control over public resources such as spectrum or right of way, and a licensing regime that applies in spite of that will be unjustified and an aberration in a liberalized economy. As our dynamic Internet and startup ecosystems depend critically on the ease with which individuals and small teams can create launch web applications, any registration requirement will have a serious detrimental effect.</p>

<p>User privacy, law enforcement access and other issues are already covered in relevant legislation, and any changes must be made by the legislative so that the same rules can apply to the wide array businesses that handle relevant data, not just CAPs.</p>

<p class="question">4. How can the regulator encourage the emergence of Indian Content and Application Providers?</p>

<p>According to NASSCOM, India is the fastest growing and third largest startup ecosystem in the world, with 3,100 startups in 2014. As demonstrated by the numerous world-leading online applications that emerged from India in the last five years, a non-discriminatory Internet is an opportunity that will allow many of them to become global leaders.</p>

<p>Lack of net neutrality, on the other hand, will create an uneven playing field, stifle competition and make it impossible for startups to challenge well funded market leaders. As the Internet startup ecosystem in India is younger than that in the west, the dominant players in many segments are currently western companies. Permitting violations of net neutrality will perpetuate this situation by enabling them to shut out competition from smaller Indian firms.</p>

<p>The Internet has been the biggest democratizing force of our generation. It has brought humanity unprecedented progress through universal access to knowledge, effective freedom of speech and innovative new products and services. This progress has been the result of a new way of governing communications, one where content and carriage are separated and independent.</p>

<p>If the principle of net neutrality is lost, this progress will be lost.</p>

<p>We, the startups that are at the forefront of creating the next wave of Internet applications, request you to uphold network neutrality and protect our nation’s thriving innovation ecosystem.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>
